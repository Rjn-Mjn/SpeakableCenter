# Traditional Server-Side Routing Setup (Option A)

## Overview
Your Speakable application is now configured with **traditional server-side routing**. This means all navigation is handled by the Express.js server, with full page reloads for each route.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Disabled Client-Side Router
- **File**: `client/src/routes/router.js` → renamed to `router.js.disabled`
- **Reason**: Removed the client-side SPA router to avoid conflicts with server-side routing

### 2. Created Dashboard Page
- **File**: `client/src/pages/Dashboard.html`
- **Purpose**: Protected page for authenticated users
- **Features**: Simple dashboard layout with navigation and placeholder cards for future features

### 3. Added Logout Route
- **File**: `server/server.js`
- **Route**: `/api/logout`
- **Function**: Properly logs out users and destroys their session

## Current Routes Structure

### Page Routes (HTML pages served by server)
- `/` - HomePage.html
- `/login` - LoginPage.html
- `/register` - LoginPage.html (same page, different mode)
- `/dashboard` - Dashboard.html (protected, requires authentication)

### API Routes
- `/api/login` - Login endpoint
- `/api/register` - Registration endpoint
- `/api/logout` - Logout endpoint
- `/api/auth/google` - Google OAuth endpoints
- `/api/config` - Configuration endpoint

## How Navigation Works Now

1. **All links use standard HTML anchors**: `<a href="/login">Login</a>`
2. **Each navigation causes a full page reload** from the server
3. **Server checks authentication** before serving protected pages
4. **No JavaScript required** for basic navigation

## Benefits of This Approach

✅ **SEO Friendly**: Search engines can easily crawl all pages
✅ **Simpler Architecture**: No complex client-side state management
✅ **Better Browser Compatibility**: Works even with JavaScript disabled
✅ **Easier Debugging**: Each page is independent
✅ **Faster Initial Load**: No large JavaScript bundles to download

## Navigation Examples

### In HTML files:
```html
<!-- Standard links -->
<a href="/">Home</a>
<a href="/login">Login</a>
<a href="/dashboard">Dashboard</a>

<!-- Logout link -->
<a href="/api/logout">Logout</a>

<!-- Back button using JavaScript (optional) -->
<button onclick="window.location.href='/'">Back to Home</button>
```

### Forms submit normally:
```html
<form action="/api/login" method="POST">
  <!-- form fields -->
  <button type="submit">Login</button>
</form>
```

## Testing Your Setup

1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Or for development with custom port:
   ```bash
   PORT=3000 NODE_ENV=development node server/server.js
   ```

2. Test navigation:
   - Visit homepage: `https://localhost:3000/`
   - Click Login link → Should load login page with full refresh
   - Try accessing Dashboard without login → Should redirect to login
   - After login → Should be able to access Dashboard
   - Click Logout → Should logout and redirect to home

## Future Considerations

If you later want to add some client-side interactivity without full SPA:
- You can use **fetch()** for AJAX form submissions
- Add **partial page updates** for specific features
- Use **progressive enhancement** - works without JS, better with JS

## Files Structure
```
Speakable/
├── client/
│   └── src/
│       ├── pages/
│       │   ├── HomePage.html
│       │   ├── LoginPage.html
│       │   └── Dashboard.html
│       └── routes/
│           └── router.js.disabled (backup of old client router)
└── server/
    └── server.js (contains all server-side routes)
```

## Notes
- The client-side router has been preserved as `router.js.disabled` in case you want to reference it later
- All navigation now relies on server-side routing
- Protected routes (like `/dashboard`) are secured at the server level
- The server handles all authentication checks before serving pages
