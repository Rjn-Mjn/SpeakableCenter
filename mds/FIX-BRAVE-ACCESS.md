# Fix Brave Browser Access to audiox.space

## Your website IS working! 
✅ **audiox.space is live and accessible globally through CloudFlare**

The issue is with your local Brave browser settings. Here's how to fix it:

## Step-by-Step Solutions

### Solution 1: Clear Brave Browser Data (Most Common Fix)
1. Open Brave browser
2. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
3. Select:
   - Time range: "All time"
   - ✅ Browsing history
   - ✅ Cookies and other site data
   - ✅ Cached images and files
4. Click "Clear data"
5. Restart Brave
6. Try accessing https://audiox.space

### Solution 2: Check Brave Shields Settings
1. Visit https://audiox.space in Brave
2. Click the Brave lion icon in the address bar
3. Make sure Shields are set to "Standard" (not Aggressive)
4. Or temporarily set "Shields Down" for audiox.space
5. Reload the page

### Solution 3: DNS Settings
Sometimes Brave uses secure DNS that might conflict. Fix it:

1. Go to Brave Settings: `brave://settings/`
2. Privacy and security → Security
3. Scroll to "Use secure DNS"
4. Either:
   - Turn it OFF temporarily
   - Or change to "With CloudFlare (1.1.1.1)"
5. Restart Brave

### Solution 4: Reset Brave Flags
1. Type in address bar: `brave://flags/`
2. Click "Reset all" button at the top
3. Restart Brave
4. Try accessing audiox.space

### Solution 5: Check Extensions
1. Type: `brave://extensions/`
2. Disable all extensions temporarily
3. Try accessing audiox.space
4. If it works, enable extensions one by one to find the culprit

### Solution 6: Create New Brave Profile
1. Click profile icon (top right)
2. Add new profile
3. Try accessing audiox.space in the new profile

### Solution 7: Check HTTPS/SSL Settings
1. Go to `brave://settings/security`
2. Under "Advanced" section
3. Make sure "Always use secure connections" is not causing issues
4. Try toggling it off temporarily

### Solution 8: Command Line Fix (Advanced)
Close Brave completely, then launch with flags:
```bash
brave --disable-features=BlockInsecurePrivateNetworkRequests --disable-web-security --user-data-dir=/tmp/brave-temp
```
This creates a temporary profile with relaxed security for testing.

## Quick Diagnostic Commands

Run these in terminal to verify your connection:
```bash
# Test if domain resolves
curl -I https://audiox.space

# Test direct CloudFlare connection
curl -I https://audiox.space -H "Host: audiox.space"

# Check SSL certificate
openssl s_client -connect audiox.space:443 -servername audiox.space < /dev/null
```

## If Nothing Works - Alternative Access Methods

### Method A: Use a Different Browser
- Firefox: https://audiox.space
- Chrome: https://audiox.space
- Zen Browser: https://audiox.space

### Method B: Use Brave in Private Window
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + N` for private window
2. Visit https://audiox.space

### Method C: Mobile Access
Try accessing from your phone's Brave browser to isolate if it's a desktop-specific issue.

## CloudFlare Settings to Check

If you have access to CloudFlare dashboard:
1. SSL/TLS → Overview → Set to "Full (strict)"
2. SSL/TLS → Edge Certificates → Always Use HTTPS: ON
3. Speed → Optimization → Auto Minify: Check all boxes
4. Check if "Under Attack Mode" is OFF

## Current Server Status
✅ Your server is running correctly on ports 80 & 443
✅ CloudFlare is properly proxying traffic
✅ SSL certificates are valid
✅ Website content is being served

## Most Likely Cause
Based on the symptoms, the most likely issues are:
1. **Brave's aggressive blocking** - Try Solution 2 (Shields)
2. **Cached bad data** - Try Solution 1 (Clear data)
3. **DNS issues** - Try Solution 3 (DNS settings)

## Test Right Now
1. Open a new private/incognito window in Brave: `Ctrl + Shift + N`
2. Visit: https://audiox.space
3. If it works in private but not normal mode = cache/cookie issue
4. If it doesn't work in private either = shields/DNS issue
